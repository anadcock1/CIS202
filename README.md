## Chapter 2
Input, Processing, and Output
The Pizza Slices homework was a good intro to Python. Looking at it now, I can see ways to improve my coding. I still use some of the same commenting structures and pseudo-code  to help me wrap my head around the project. 

## Chapter 3
Decision Structures and Boolean Logic
This homework assignment was the Speeding HW. I'm familiar with if/else statements, and this one was relatively easier to work through. I did enjoy the formatting portion of it, and trying to have a little fun with it. While the early problems do seem like fancy calculators, I can start seeing the other things I could do with Python.
Starting with Chapter 3, I went back and worked all of the pracice problems. This really helps with making sure I understand the concepts taught that week. 

## Chapter 4
Repetition Structures
Ah! The Bakery Problem! I think I had the most fun with this. I'm still working on understanding use-cases for while and for loops. 

## Chapter 5
Functions
I think I had the most problem with functions. I'm still working on the practice problems in the book. Much like at the beginning, using some commenting to help me structure my programs helps a lot.
